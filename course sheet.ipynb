Part of the skill of creating and using functions is to have a function properly capture an idea such as “find the smallest value in a list of values”. Later we will show you code that finds the smallest in a list of values and we will present it to you as a function named min which takes a list of values as its argument and returns the smallest value in the list."

    "- is executable code. Python functions are written with a new statement, the def. Unlike functions in compiled languages such as C, def is an executable state- ment—your function does not exist until Python reaches and runs the def. In fact, it’s legal (and even occasionally useful) to nest def statements inside if statements, while loops, and even other defs. In typical operation, def statements are coded in module files and are naturally run to generate functions when the module file they reside in is first imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### def \n",
    "- creates an object and assigns it to a name. When Python reaches and runs a def statement, it generates a new function object and assigns it to the function’s name. As with all assignments, the function name becomes a reference to the func- tion object. There’s nothing magic about the name of a function—as you’ll see, the function object can be assigned to other names, stored in a list, and so on. Function objects may also have arbitrary user-defined attributes attached to them to record data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### lambda \n",
    "- creates an object but returns it as a result. Functions may also be created with the lambda expression, a feature that allows us to in-line function definitions in places where a def statement won’t work syntactically. This is a more advanced concept that we’ll defer until Chapter 19.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### return \n",
    "- sends a result object back to the caller. When a function is called, the caller stops until the function finishes its work and returns control to the caller. Functions that compute a value send it back to the caller with a return statement; the returned value becomes the result of the function call. A return without a value simply returns to the caller (and sends back None, the default result).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### yield \n",
    "- sends a result object back to the caller, but remembers where it left off. Functions known as generators may also use the yield statement to send back\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### global \n",
    "- declares module-level variables that are to be assigned. By default, all names assigned in a function are local to that function and exist only while the function runs. To assign a name in the enclosing module, functions need to list it in a global statement. More generally, names are always looked up in scopes— places where variables are stored—and assignments bind names to scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### nonlocal \n",
    "- declares enclosing function variables that are to be assigned. Simi- larly, the nonlocal statement added in Python 3.X allows a function to assign a name that exists in the scope of a syntactically enclosing def statement. This allows enclosing functions to serve as a place to retain state—information remembered between function calls—without using shared global names.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Arguments \n",
    "- are passed by assignment (object reference). In Python, arguments are passed to functions by assignment (which, as we’ve learned, means by object reference). As you’ll see, in Python’s model the caller and function share objects by references, but there is no name aliasing.

Because of this, a lambda can appear in places a def is not allowed by Python’s syntax—inside a list literal or a function call’s arguments, for example. With def, functions can be referenced by name but must be created elsewhere. As an expression, lambda returns a value (a new func- tion) that can optionally be assigned a name. In contrast, the def statement always assigns the new function to the name in the header, instead of returning it as a result.\n",
    "- lambda’s body is a single expression, not a block of statements. The lambda’s body is similar to what you’d put in a def body’s return statement; you simply type the result as a naked expression, instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general than a def—you can only squeeze so much logic into a lambda body without using statements such as if.

They are entirely optional—you can always use def instead, and should if your function requires the power of full statements that the lambda’s expression cannot easily provide—but they tend to be simpler coding constructs in scenarios where you just need to embed small bits of executable code inline at the place it is to be used.\n",
    "For instance, we’ll see later that callback handlers are frequently coded as inline lambda expressions embedded directly in a registration call’s arguments list, instead of being defined with a def elsewhere in a file and referenced by name (see the sidebar “Why You Will Care: lambda Callbacks” on page 573 for an example).\n",

    "the top level of a module file become attributes of the imported module object. As we saw in the last part of this book, imports give access to names in a module’s global scope. That is, the module file’s global scope morphs into the module object’s attribute namespace when it is imported. Ultimately, Python’s modules allow us to link indi- vidual files into a larger program system.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, modules have at least three roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code reuse: Unlike code you type at the Python interactive prompt, which goes away when you exit Python, code in module files is persistent—it can be reloaded and rerun as many times as needed\n",
    "- System namespace partitioning: Modules are also the highest-level program organization unit in Python. Although they are fundamentally just packages of names, these packages are also self-con- tained—you can never see a name in another file, unless you explicitly import that file. Much like the local scopes of functions, this helps avoid name clashes across your programs\n",

    "#### How Imports Work\n",
    "The prior section talked about importing modules without really explaining what hap- pens when you do so. Because imports are at the heart of program structure in Python, this section goes into more formal detail on the import operation to make this process less abstract.\n",
    "Some C programmers like to compare the Python module import operation to a C #include, but they really shouldn’t—in Python, imports are not just textual insertions of one file into another. They are really runtime operations that perform three distinct steps the first time a program imports a given file:\n",
    "1. Find the module’s file.\n",
    "2. Compile it to byte code (if needed).\n",
    "3. Run the module’s code to build the objects it defines.\n",
    "To better understand module imports, we’ll explore these steps in turn. Bear in mind that all three of these steps are carried out only the first time a module is imported during a program’s execution; later imports of the same module in a program run bypass all of these steps and simply fetch the already loaded module object in memory. Technically, Python does this by storing loaded modules in a table named sys.mod ules and checking there at the start of an import operation. If the module is not present, a three-step process begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "1. Find It\n",
    "First, Python must locate the module file referenced by an import statement. Notice that the import statement in the prior section’s example names the file without a .py extension and without its directory path: it just says import b, instead of something like import c:\\dir1\\b.py. Path and extension details are omitted on purpose; instead, Python uses a standard module search path and known file types to locate the module file corresponding to an import statement.1 Because this is the main part of the import operation that programmers must know about, we’ll return to this topic in a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compile It (Maybe)\n",
    "After finding a source code file that matches an import statement by traversing the module search path, Python next compiles it to byte code, if necessary. We discussed byte code briefly in Chapter 2, but it’s a bit richer than explained there. During an import operation Python checks both file modification times and the byte code’s Python version number to decide how to proceed. The former uses file “timestamps,” and the latter uses either a “magic” number embedded in the byte code or a filename, depending on the Python release being used. This step chooses an action as follows:\n",
    "Compile\n",
    "If the byte code file is older than the source file (i.e., if you’ve changed the source) or was created by a different Python version, Python automatically regenerates the byte code when the program is run.\n",
    "As discussed ahead, this model is modified somewhat in Python 3.2 and later— byte code files are segregated in a __pycache__ subdirectory and named with their Python version to avoid contention and recompiles when multiple Pythons are installed. This obviates the need to check version numbers in the byte code, but the timestamp check is still used to detect changes in the source.\n",
    "Don’t compile\n",
    "If, on the other hand, Python finds a .pyc byte code file that is not older than the corresponding .py source file and was created by the same Python version, it skips the source-to-byte-code compile step.\n",
    "In addition, if Python finds only a byte code file on the search path and no source, it simply loads the byte code directly; this means you can ship a program as just byte code files and avoid sending source. In other words, the compile step is by- passed if possible to speed program startup.\n",
    "Notice that compilation happens when a file is being imported. Because of this, you will not usually see a .pyc byte code file for the top-level file of your program, unless it is also imported elsewhere—only imported files leave behind .pyc files on your ma- chine. The byte code of top-level files is used internally and discarded; byte code of imported files is saved in files to speed future imports.\n",
    "Top-level files are often designed to be executed directly and not imported at all. Later, we’ll see that it is possible to design a file that serves both as the top-level code of a program and as a module of tools to be imported. Such a file may be both executed and imported, and thus does generate a .pyc. To learn how this works, watch for the discussion of the special __name__ attribute and __main__ in Chapter 25.\n",
    "3. Run It\n",
    "The final step of an import operation executes the byte code of the module. All state- ments in the file are run in turn, from top to bottom, and any assignments made to names during this step generate attributes of the resulting module object. This is how the tools defined by the module’s code are created. For instance, def statements in a file are run at import time to create functions and assign attributes within the module to those functions. The functions can then be called later in the program by the file’s importers.\n",
    "Because this last import step actually runs the file’s code, if any top-level code in a module file does real work, you’ll see its results at import time. For example, top-level print statements in a module show output when the file is imported. Function def statements simply define objects for later use.\n",
    "As you can see, import operations involve quite a bit of work—they search for files, possibly run a compiler, and run Python code. Because of this, any given module is imported only once per process by default. Future imports skip all three import steps and reuse the already loaded module in memory. If you need to import a file again after it has already been loaded (for example, to support dynamic end-user customizations), you have to force the issue with an imp.reload call—a tool we’ll meet in the next chapter.2\n"

You can call modules just about anything you like, but module filenames should end in a .py suffix if you plan to import them. The .py is technically optional for top-level files that will be run but not imported, but adding it in all cases makes your files’ types more obvious and allows you to import any of your files in the future.\n",
    "Because module names become variable names inside a Python program (without the .py), they should also follow the normal variable name rules outlined in Chap- ter 11. For instance, you can create a module file named if.py, but you cannot import it because if is a reserved word—when you try to run import if, you’ll get a syntax error. In fact, both the names of module files and the names of directories used in package imports (discussed in the next chapter) must conform to the rules for variable names presented in Chapter 11; they may, for instance, contain only letters, digits, and underscores. Package directories also cannot contain platform-specific syntax such as spaces in their names."
