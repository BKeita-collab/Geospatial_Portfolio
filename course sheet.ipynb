Part of the skill of creating and using functions is to have a function properly capture an idea such as “find the smallest value in a list of values”. Later we will show you code that finds the smallest in a list of values and we will present it to you as a function named min which takes a list of values as its argument and returns the smallest value in the list."

    "- is executable code. Python functions are written with a new statement, the def. Unlike functions in compiled languages such as C, def is an executable state- ment—your function does not exist until Python reaches and runs the def. In fact, it’s legal (and even occasionally useful) to nest def statements inside if statements, while loops, and even other defs. In typical operation, def statements are coded in module files and are naturally run to generate functions when the module file they reside in is first imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### def \n",
    "- creates an object and assigns it to a name. When Python reaches and runs a def statement, it generates a new function object and assigns it to the function’s name. As with all assignments, the function name becomes a reference to the func- tion object. There’s nothing magic about the name of a function—as you’ll see, the function object can be assigned to other names, stored in a list, and so on. Function objects may also have arbitrary user-defined attributes attached to them to record data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### lambda \n",
    "- creates an object but returns it as a result. Functions may also be created with the lambda expression, a feature that allows us to in-line function definitions in places where a def statement won’t work syntactically. This is a more advanced concept that we’ll defer until Chapter 19.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### return \n",
    "- sends a result object back to the caller. When a function is called, the caller stops until the function finishes its work and returns control to the caller. Functions that compute a value send it back to the caller with a return statement; the returned value becomes the result of the function call. A return without a value simply returns to the caller (and sends back None, the default result).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### yield \n",
    "- sends a result object back to the caller, but remembers where it left off. Functions known as generators may also use the yield statement to send back\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### global \n",
    "- declares module-level variables that are to be assigned. By default, all names assigned in a function are local to that function and exist only while the function runs. To assign a name in the enclosing module, functions need to list it in a global statement. More generally, names are always looked up in scopes— places where variables are stored—and assignments bind names to scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### nonlocal \n",
    "- declares enclosing function variables that are to be assigned. Simi- larly, the nonlocal statement added in Python 3.X allows a function to assign a name that exists in the scope of a syntactically enclosing def statement. This allows enclosing functions to serve as a place to retain state—information remembered between function calls—without using shared global names.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Arguments \n",
    "- are passed by assignment (object reference). In Python, arguments are passed to functions by assignment (which, as we’ve learned, means by object reference). As you’ll see, in Python’s model the caller and function share objects by references, but there is no name aliasing. Changing an argument name within a function does not also change the corresponding name in the caller, but changing passed-in mutable objects in place can change objects shared by the caller, and serve as a function result.\n",

Because of this, a lambda can appear in places a def is not allowed by Python’s syntax—inside a list literal or a function call’s arguments, for example. With def, functions can be referenced by name but must be created elsewhere. As an expression, lambda returns a value (a new func- tion) that can optionally be assigned a name. In contrast, the def statement always assigns the new function to the name in the header, instead of returning it as a result.\n",
    "- lambda’s body is a single expression, not a block of statements. The lambda’s body is similar to what you’d put in a def body’s return statement; you simply type the result as a naked expression, instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general than a def—you can only squeeze so much logic into a lambda body without using statements such as if.

    "Generally speaking, lambda comes in handy as a sort of function shorthand that allows you to embed a function’s definition within the code that uses it. They are entirely optional—you can always use def instead, and should if your function requires the power of full statements that the lambda’s expression cannot easily provide—but they tend to be simpler coding constructs in scenarios where you just need to embed small bits of executable code inline at the place it is to be used.\n",
    "For instance, we’ll see later that callback handlers are frequently coded as inline lambda expressions embedded directly in a registration call’s arguments list, instead of being defined with a def elsewhere in a file and referenced by name (see the sidebar “Why You Will Care: lambda Callbacks” on page 573 for an example).\n",

The preceding code snippet, for example, builds up a list of three functions by embedding lambda expressions inside a list literal; a def won’t work inside a list literal like this because it is a statement, not an expression. The equivalent def coding would require temporary function names (which might clash with others) and function definitions outside the context of intended use (which might be hundreds of lines away):"
